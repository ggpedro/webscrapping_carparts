## Web scrapping project
These scripts were made with Python with the main purpose to get photos of car parts according to their part number (identification code) across other sites who already have these images. The images are not used commercially, just for purposes to organize our inventory and identify the parts to show the customer presencially without needing to pick up the car part.

##### â€¢ Made in Python with Selenium library
